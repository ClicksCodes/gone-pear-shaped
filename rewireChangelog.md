> **Games** 
> ====
> Who'd have thought that the most important thing on a game bot is the game itself.

We are redoing how games look. Each round is going to be a message which gets edited as you go through the round.

These new messages are going to complete with fancy new GIFs to add to the games themselves.

# Planned features...

> **Custom decks** 
> ====
> Of course every server has its own set of inside jokes. Maybe Chizel is small and you want that to be a card.
> Well, we're working on that.

Everyone wants to make their own decks, so that is now possible.

By using Connect My Pairs, you can create *2* of your very own decks complete with both question and answer cards.

You can set your decks to be public, unlisted or private. Private decks can by used in a game you start, and unlisted ones can be used by anyone, if they know the code.
