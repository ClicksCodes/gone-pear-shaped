> **High Uptime** 
> ====
> Gone Pair Shaped will go down into maintinance mode for a short amount of time. Games cannot be started in this period 
> and current games will be left to finish.


> **Low Latency** 
> ====
> The average ping time of the bot is around 15ms, allowing you to play games with little delay.


> **Custom Cards** 
> ====
> Add your own custom cards to your game. All you need to do is run the `$custom` command. You can add them in Discord or add text files for your cards. Placeholders can be used like `{judge}` to add the name of the judge that round. For more information, check the *Custom* section.


> **Customisable**
> ====
> Customise your game with every option from shuffles to player timeouts.


## Before you play...
#### Once you add the bot there are a couple of things you might want to do.

<dl>
  <dt><h3>Accept the terms</h3></dt>
  <dd>To use msot commands, you need to accept the <code>$terms</code> by reacting with the tick. This can only be done by people with the <b>Manage Server</b> permission.</dd>
  <hr>
  <dt><h3>Set a prefix</h3></dt>
  <dd>You can set a prefix by using <code>$setprefix </code> followed by the prefixes you want to use, separated by spaces. To add a prefix with a space in, surround it with "" or ''.<br>
  If any issues happen with the prefix, pinging the bot will always work and cannot be disabled. So if you ever forget the prefix, you can @ the bot and <code>setprefix</code></dd>
</dl>

<hr>

## Let's play!
### It's time to start a game - How is this done?

<dl>
  <dt>
    <h3>
      Start the game
    </h3>
    <p>
      Firstly, we need to initialise a game. This is done with the <code>$play</code> command.<br>
      You will next be prompted with a menu.<br>
      If you have reactions disabled, you can send the emoji in chat instead of clicking it.
    </p>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <h3>
      Want a new game?
    </h3>
    <p>
